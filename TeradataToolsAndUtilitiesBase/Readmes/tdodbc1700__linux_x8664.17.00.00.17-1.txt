1.0 Introduction

    This release of the ODBC driver for Teradata will support Teradata 17.00
    features in both Teradata and (Entry Level) ANSI modes, and is backwards
    compatible with previous releases of Teradata as noted in section 3.2.

    The TTU has introduced a new TTU directory tree structure which
    has unified all the TTU products under a common TTU release directory.
    The ODBC installation package has taken steps to make this new tree
    structure transparent to the existing ODBC users.  Please refer Appendix
    A and B for recommended usage of ODBC paths and odbc.ini file.


2.0 Release Content

    2.1 Enhancements & New Features
        The following new features are introduced in Teradata ODBC Driver 17.00.00.017.
        
        * [TDS-154] Return output parameters as result set

        You can now configure the driver to return output parameters as a result 
        set. To do this, select the Return Output Parameters As Result Set check 
        box (or set the OutputAsResultSet connection property to 1). For more 
        information, see the ODBC Driver for Teradata User Guide.

        * [TDS-347] Support for enhanced stored procedure names

        The driver now supports stored procedures whose names include dot notation 
        and back-ticks (`).

    2.2 Resolved Issues
        The following issues were resolved in Teradata ODBC Driver 17.00.00.017.
        
        * [TDS 321] In some cases, the driver terminates unexpectedly with an 
        out of memory error.

        * [TDS-351] When an application inserts rows that include LOB columns, 
        and one row fails with an error such as "duplicate unique primary key", 
        error, the subsequent inserts return various other errors.

        This issue has been resolved. The driver now has better Teradata database 
        error handling when executing parameterized insert queries with LOB data.

        * [TDS-352] If multiple errors occur during a session, for each error 
        the driver displays all the previously displayed error messages from the 
        session. 

        This issue has been resolved. The driver now only displays the error 
        message for the most recent error.

        * [TDS-356] Database error messages that include Japanese characters 
        are displayed as unreadable characters.

    2.3 Teradata issues that no longer occur

        * ODBC Driver reports incorrect ODBC version

        * ODBC driver v 14.10.0.6 and higher having high RAM utilization
          impacting MS Access 2010
      
        * SQL Assistant 16.10 Problem with ODBC driver and LOBs

        * ODBC Light Weight Parser fails to compile Stored Procedure when
          Stored Procedure has comments in body

        * ODBC Driver throws [Error 22003] [Numeric value out of range] using
          SQLBindParameter when the whole portion contains leading zeros and
          whole portion > (Precision - Scale) is inserted into DECIMAL column
     
    2.4 Known Issues

    The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in 
    the data source, the driver, or an application.

        * Some custom fields not supported for SQLGetDescField
        
          When calling SQLGetDescField, the driver does not support the
          SQL_DESC_TD_ACTIVITY_TYPE and SQL_DESC_TD_COST_ESTIMATE custom header 
          description fields.
          
        * Catalog functions always return ODBC 3.x column names.
          
          For catalog functions, the driver returns the ODBC 3.x column names rather 
          than ODBC 2.x column names, even in an ODBC 2.x environment.

        * The SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR statement attribute cannot be set properly.
        
          You can set a value by calling SQLSetStmtAttr(SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR),
          but the value is reset after you close the cursor. The value that you set
          does not persist.
          
        * In specific cases, during INSERT operations that require the data to be
          truncated, there is no message indicating that truncation has occurred.
          
          This behavior occurs when:
          - The Session Mode option (the SessionMode property) is set to Teradata,
          - The driver inserts data that is too large for the target column.

          The database truncates the data to fit, but the message indicating that 
          truncation has occurred is not returned. The driver expects the database 
          to report the truncation. However, when Session Mode is set to Teradata, 
          the database does not return the truncation message.
          
          
    2.5 Version History

        2.5.1 
            Version 17.00.00.016 Resolved Issues
            * [TDS-335] Support for macOS 10.15

            The driver now supports macOS 10.15 "Catalina".

            * [TDS-320] Built with Xcode 10.2.1

            On macOS, the driver is now built with Xcode 10.2.1.

            * [TDS-327] Support for RHEL 8

            The driver now supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.

            * [TDS-334] Support for Oracle Enterprise Linux 8

            The driver now supports Oracle Enterprise Linux 8.
        
            Version 17.00.00.015 Resolved Issues
            * [TDS-301] The ODBC driver for Windows is now built with Visual Studio 2019.

            * [TDS-319] Improved performance during connection time
 
            When connecting to the database, the driver can now detect and use the 
            transaction isolation level that is configured on the database by default. 
            Before, the driver sent a request to set the transaction isolation level
            for each connection.
   
            * [TDS-326] Support for notarization
 
            The driver now supports notarization on macOS systems, enabling it to be 
            run on macOS versions 10.14.6 and later.
            
            * [TDS-316] When converting data from one type to another, if the length 
            of the metadata is greater than the column size, the driver returns a 
            truncation error.
   
            * [TDS-304] When selecting an empty column, if you provide a buffer
            length of 0 in the SQLGetData call, the driver does not return the expected
            truncation warning.
   
            * [SENTDO-1755] In specific cases, when using UTF-8 as the session character 
            set and retrieving data that uses the KANJISJIS character set, the driver 
            returns incorrect data.
   
            This issue has been resolved. Before, the following scenario would cause
            the driver to use an incorrect column length when returning data:
            - The Session Character Set option (or CharacterSet property) is set to 
            UTF8.
            - The table contains two or more consecutive columns that use KANJISJIS as 
            the character set.
            - You call SQLFetch and SQLGetData to retrieve data from these columns.

            The driver is now able to retrieve the data correctly.

            * [TDS-322] When querying interval data, if the application sets a
            precision that is greater than 2, the driver returns an "Interval Field 
            Overflow" error.
           
            * [TDS-325] When the database cannot infer the type of a parameter marker
            in a SQLDescribeParam() call, the driver returns a parameter size of 0.

            This issue has been resolved. In this scenario, the driver now calculates a 
            parameter size by dividing 64000 by the number of parameter markers.

            * [TDS-329] When the driver returns the NUMBER value "0" using a string
            data type such as CHARACTER, the returned value uses an incorrect 
            precision.

            * [SENTDO-1765] The driver uses inconsistent names for some connection 
            properties.

            This issue has been resolved. Before, various components in the driver used
            different names to refer to these properties:
            - AccountString or AccountStr
            - NoHelpDatabase or DontUseHelpDatabase

            The driver now consistently uses AccountStr and DontUseHelpDatabase as the
            names of these properties. For more information, see the Installation and
            Configuration Guide.

            Note: "Account" continues to be accepted as an alias for the AccountStr 
            property.
        
            * [SENTDO-1761] On Windows and macOS, the Driver Options dialog box displays 
            an incorrect default value for the Reconnect Interval option.
            
            Version 17.00.00.012 Resolved Issues
            * [SENTDO-1704] Updated driver version information in Linux binary
            You can now check the Linux driver's version from the driver binary file. 
            To do this, open the .so file in a text editor, and search for the text
            "$driver_version_sb$:". The driver's version number is listed after this
            text.
   
            * [TDS-309] Prefixes for log file names
            The driver now includes a prefix in the names of the log files that are 
            generated when logging is enabled. The prefix includes the user name 
            associated with the connection and the process ID of the application 
            through which the connection is made.
   
            * [TDS-308] Improvements for logging level 6 (TRACE)
            The log messages that the driver generates when logging is enabled at level
            6 (TRACE) have been updated to be more detailed and precise. This includes
            improvements such as providing more accurate descriptions of socket errors
            and more consistently printing the correct session IDs.
        
            * [TDS-311] When you try to run a CREATE PROCEDURE or REPLACE PROCEDURE
            command, if the "CREATE" or "REPLACE" part of the command is immediately
            followed by a tab character, the driver returns a syntax error.
   
            * [TDS-304] When using the driver in an ADODB application, if you try to
            retrieve an empty string, the driver returns an error.
   
            * [TDS-297] On big-endian platforms such as AIX or HP-UX, when you try to 
            run a "SELECT current_date" query, the driver returns the following error 
            message: "Conversion from number to string failed due to undersized 
            character buffer."
   
            * [TDS-228] In some cases, when converting a Thai language character from 
            UTF-8 encoding to another encoding type, the driver reports a truncation
            error.
        
            * [TDS-292] Setting the Enable Redrive option to "Default" 
            (EnableRedrive=DEFAULT) is equivalent to enabling the property 
            (EnableRedrive=Yes).
   
            This issue has been resolved. When this property is set to "Default", the
            driver now determines whether or not to use Redrive based on the
            configuration of the database.
        
            Version 17.00.00.010 Resolved Issues
            
            * [TDS-129] FastExport support
            
            The driver now supports the FastExport feature from Teradata Database. The
            FastExport protocol improves the performance of SELECT statements that meet 
            certain criteria. For more information, see the ODBC Driver for Teradata®
            User Guide.
   
            * [TDS-218] Native Object Store (NOS) Support

            The driver now supports the use of the NOS feature from Teradata Database.
            For more information, see the Teradata Database documentation.
            
            * [TDS-216] SQLDescribeCol() and SQLColAttributes() return incorrect
            column sizes for CURRENT TIMESTAMP(n) columns.
        
            * [TDS-268] When the Enable Extended Statement Information option (or the 
            EnableExtendedStmtInfo property) is disabled, some cells in the 
            DBC.DBQLogTbl table display as "<Error>".
           
            * [TDS-269] The driver cannot insert TIMESTAMP parameter data that
            contains fractional digits.
        
            * [TDS-274] When using a prepared statement to call a stored procedure
            that contains CLOB output parameters, the driver returns an error.
                
            * [TDS-286] When connected to a Teradata Database 16.20 instance, and 
            INTERVAL data types are bound to the SQL_C_BINARY type, the driver cannot 
            query INTERVAL data.
        
            * [TDS-289] In some cases, when you select and expand a view containing
            characters that are not ASCII-compatible, the driver returns an error.
   
            * [TDS-295] In some cases, when two or more connections are created at 
            the same time, the driver terminates unexpectedly.
        
            * [TDS-303] When LATIN1252_30A is used as the character set for the
            session, the driver does not return the euro symbol (€) correctly.
            
            Version 17.00.00.007 Resolved Issues
                    
            * [TDS-290] Updated ICU version
            The driver now uses ICU version 58.2.x.
   
            * [TDS-287] Updated support for interval, time zone, and XML data types
 
            You can now configure the driver to return these data types as 
            SQL_WLONGVARCHAR instead of the default SQL types, which map more closely
            to the Teradata data type but may not be supported in .NET applications. To 
            do this, configure the new IntervalPeriodTypesToString connection property. 
        
            * [TDS-280] If the driver fails to retrieve the name of the user account
            that is currently logged into the client machine, then the driver returns
            SQL_ERROR and the connection fails.
   
            This issue has been resolved. The driver now logs the issue, but connects 
            to the database successfully. 
   
            * [TDS-285] When attempting to retrieve a field descriptor with an
            identifier value that is between 1300 to 1399 (inclusive), the driver
            returns an "invalid descriptor field" error.

            * [TDS-292] In some cases, when the Enable Redrive option is set to
            "Default" (EnableRedrive=REDRIVE_DEFAULT), the driver fails to run queries.
   
            As an interim workaround, the driver has been updated to treat the
            Default (or REDRIVE_DEFAULT) setting as being equivalent to when this 
            property is enabled, instead of attempting to detect whether or not the 
            Redrive feature is enabled on the server.
   
            * [TDS-293] In some cases, applications on Linux might have problems 
            accessing the dynamically linked libraries that are used by the driver.

            This issue has been resolved. On Linux, the third-party libraries are now 
            statically linked.
            
            Version 17.00.00.005 Resolved Issues


            * [TDS-288] Driver logs do not include error messages about string 
            truncation.

            * [TDS-275] The driver cannot parse queries that contain carriage return
            characters (\r).
   
            This issue has been resolved. The driver now replaces carriage return
            characters with spaces, and parses these queries successfully.
   
            * [TDS-283] The driver does not allow queries of empty strings.
      
            Version 17.00.00.004 Resolved Issues
            
            * [TDS-253] Improved logging
            When logging is enabled, the log files now include more information. This
            includes information that was previously only available through the tracing
            feature in the driver manager.
        
            * [SENTDO-1428] Improved security for credentials in DSNs
            The driver has been updated to only allow Teradata Wallet reference strings 
            to be saved in DSNs. You can no longer type passwords and authentication
            parameters as-is and then save those values in DSNs.
      
            As part of this update, some changes have been made to the DSN Setup dialog
            box:
            - The Authentication Parameter field has been renamed to Parameter Wallet 
            String.
            - The Teradata Wallet String field has been renamed to Password Wallet
            String.
            - The Password field has been removed.
   
            For more information, see the ODBC Driver for Teradata User Guide.
   
            * [SENTDO-351] Redrive support
            The driver now supports the Redrive feature, if it is also enabled in the
            Teradata Database that you are connecting to. Redrive enables the driver to
            respond to network errors, database failures, and database restarts by
            automatically reconnecting to the database and resuming any requests that
            were interrupted.
   
            To enable this feature, enable the Enable Redrive option (or EnableRedrive
            property) and set the Reconnect Count option (or ReconnectCount property)
            to a non-zero value. You can also enable or disable Redrive on the
            statement level by using the SQL_ATTR_REDRIVE statement attribute. For more
            information, see the ODBC Driver for Teradata User Guide.
            
            Version 16.20.00.054 Resolved Issues

            * [TDS-207] SQLDescribeCol is returning a larger column size when using utf8.
            In 16.10 column size of 1 is returned and in 16.20 a column size of 2 is returned
            for UTF8 when column is defined as CHAR(1). This behavior doesn’t occur with
            other character sets like UTF16 or ASCII, or when we do execute direct.

            * [TDS-208] On Linux platforms (i.e. Linux, zLinux (s390x) & Ubuntu), the driver now
            dynamically links ICU & OpenSSL libraries. A new "Thirdparty" folder is created to
            hold ICU & OpenSSL libraries under "lib"/"lib64". Also, note that the driver is
            footprint reduced. Hence, the overall driver size is smaller than in the past.

            * [TDS-212] On Windows and Mac OSX platform, when the "Use Regional Settings for
            Decimal Symbol" option is checked and the system uses something other than periods
            as the decimal character, users might experience error when retrieving data from
            decimal/float type columns using an array size of 2 or more.

            A fix was implemented for this problem; the affected types could be retrieved and
            displayed correctly now when the "Use Regional Settings for Decimal Symbol" option
            is enabled.

            * [TDS-216] For SQLDescribeCol() call, the driver does not return correct column size
            when the data type is TIME or TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE.

            * [TDS-219] Japanese Help text is now available.

            * [TDS-223] On Linux, the driver does not set SO_KEEPALIVE properly.

            * [TDS-224] For SQLProcedures() call, the driver does not return OBJECT_TYPE "L".

            * [TDS-226] In the situation of user's password expired, the driver cannot connect
            after the user has provided a new password.

            * [TDS-233] The driver fails to perform a SELECT query from a table that contains
            non-Latin character (Cyrillic) data.
            
            Version 16.20.00.050 Resolved Issues
            * [TDS-90] In some cases, when you execute a CREATE TABLE command and 
            the database returns a warning message, the driver ignores the message and 
            returns SQL_SUCCESS.

            This issue has been resolved. The driver now returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO
            and conveys warning messages from the database.

            * [TDS-193] In some cases, the application in which you are using the
            driver stops responding, and you might see error messages that mention 
            "exceeding supplied buffer" or "protocol deserialization failed".

            * [TDS-202] When using the driver on a macOS 10.13 machine, if you click
            the Help button, the documentation does not display correctly.

            * [TDS-205] In some cases, SQLTables reports incorrect table types for
            for certain tables.

            * [TDS-205] In some cases, SQLColumns returns "0" for the number of 
            decimal places in NUMBER columns where it should report "NULL".

            * [SENTDO-1396] When the driver is installed on a machine that uses Turkish 
            locale settings, if you try to connect using a connection string where one 
            or more of the property names contains a lower-case "i" character, the 
            driver fails to parse the string and does not connect to the server.

            * [TDS-211] When executing parameterized queries, the driver incorrectly
            converts Unicode literals to 8-bit characters.

            * [TDS-210] When you call SQLGetInfo to retrieve the SQL_DBMS_VER
            information, the driver reports an incorrect version number.

            Version 16.20.00.049 Resolved Issues
            * [TDS-191] SLES 15 support
              The driver now supports SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.

            * [TDS-178] Windows logging dialog update
              On Windows, the Event Logging check box is now in the Logging Options 
              dialog box, and is labeled Enable Event Tracing For Windows.
              
            * [TDS-200] On Windows, the ODBC Data Source Administrator does not 
              display context-sensitive help.

            * [TDS-185] Microsoft Access cannot link a Teradata database table 
              using a CLOB column.

            * [TDS-141] There is no indication when SQLDescribeParam is called for 
              an expression involving a parameter for which the database cannot 
              determine a type and/or length.
              This issue has been resolved. Now, the indicator SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO 
              indicates that the SQLDescribeParam function has been called for an 
              unknown parameter.
              
            Version 16.20.00.048 Resolved Issues
            * [ODBC-3529] Improved driver performance during query execution
              When executing a query, the driver now automatically chooses whether to use 
              the RESP or KEEPRESP option depending on whether the result set is expected
              to contain any LOB data. This ensures that the optimal setting is used for
              each query.
          
            * [TDS-197] Standardized log file names
              When logging is enabled, the driver now produces the following log files:
              - A simbateradataodbcdriver.log file that logs driver activity that is not
                specific to a connection.
              - A simbateradataodbcdriver_connection_[Number].log file for each 
                connection made to the database, where [Number] is a number that 
                identifies each log file. This file logs driver activity that is specific 
                to the connection.
                
            * [TDS-190] When you use the ODBC Data Source Administrator to configure 
              a DSN, if the Username field is empty but the Use Integrated Security check
              box is selected, the driver terminates unexpectedly.
            
            Version 16.20.00.045 Resolved Issues
            * [ODBC-3472] User-Defined Function (UDF) source file uploads
              You can now create and update UDFs by uploading client-side files where the 
              UDFs are defined. For more information, see the Installation and 
              Configuration Guide.
   
            * [SENTDO-1261] Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) 
              On Windows, you can now use ETW to configure logging for kernel-level 
              events. For information about ETW, see "Event Tracing" in the Microsoft
              Windows documentation: 
              https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/etw/event-tracing-portal.

            * [ODBC-17993] Smart LOB (SLOB) Mode enabled by default
              The driver now uses SLOB Mode by default to retrieve LOB data types,
              instead of using Deferred Mode. For more information about these LOB
              retrieval modes, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

              As a result, the default values have changed for the following 
              configuration options:
              - Max Single LOB Bytes (MaxSingleLOBBytes) now defaults to 4000.
              - Max Total LOB Bytes Per Row (MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow) now defaults to 
                65536).

            * [TDS-183] macOS 10.13 support
              The driver now officially supports macOS 10.13.

            * [TDS-173] Ubuntu 18.04 support
              The driver now officially supports Ubuntu 18.04. 
              
            * [TDS-180] If you bind a NULL or 0 value to a DECIMAL column in the last
              set of a parameter array, the driver writes incorrectly scaled data for
              that column in the database.
              
            Version 16.20.00.1043 Resolved Issues 
            * [TDS-167] A memory allocation error can occur under the following 
              conditions:
              - When SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE is set to a number greater than 1
              - Array mode is used to insert multiple rows 
              - There is a combination of null and non-null values of the SQL attribute
                parameters
              The driver returns the following message when this occurs: 
              "std::bad_alloc exception caught".
   
            * [TDS-179] On Unix or Linux systems, driver manager software may not 
              be correctly detected. 
          
            * [TDS-182] When you insert CLOB data with the connection attribute
              SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_ON enabled, the database error "The parcel stream
              is invalid" may occur.

            * [TDS-184] The DSN parameter AccountStr is incorrectly implemented
              as AccountString.
        
            Version 16.20.00.1036 Resolved Issues 
            * [TDS-119] In some cases, when installed on a machine that runs an
              earlier version of AIX, the driver cannot be loaded.
   
            * [TDS-158] On Windows, when the driver opens a dialog box to prompt you
              for additional connection information, the Mechanism and Session Charset
              drop-down lists cannot be fully displayed at the same time.

            * [TDS-86] When you use the driver with the DataDirect driver manager, 
              the driver fails to convert ANSI ODBC function calls to Unicode ODBC 
              function calls.

            * [TDS-121] The driver returns incorrect parameter counts for queries 
              that contain nested UDM (user-defined method) functions, and fails to execute 
              these queries.

            * [TDS-163] The driver cannot connect to Teradata Database instances that
              have the "Require Confidentiality" option enabled.
   
            * [TDS-160] When attempting to insert a NULL value into a PERIOD column
              as a parameter, the driver returns an error.

            * [TDS-148] In some cases, when executing DELETE statements with arrays 
              of parameters, the driver returns SQL_NO_DATA instead of SQL_SUCCESS when
              no rows are affected.
        
            Version 16.20.00.1032 Resolved Issues
            * Support for DataDirect driver manager version 8.x
 
              The driver is now compatible with version 8.x of the DataDirect driver 
              manager.
   
            * Internal driver improvements
            
              The driver has been updated with internal security improvements.
              
            * When you use the driver with the DataDirect driver manager,
              you cannot authenticate the connection using a password that is longer than
              107 characters.

            * When you execute a distributed query on a SQL Server linked 
              server, the driver returns an error.
   
            * When you use a distributed query to retrieve data from a
              FLOAT or TIME column on a SQL Server linked server, the driver returns an
              error.
   
            * In some cases, the driver overrides AGKR (Auto Generated Key
              Retrieval) settings that were specified before the connection was 
              established.
   
            * If SQLDescribeCol is called multiple times on the same
              prepared statement, the driver returns an empty column name after the first
              time.
   
            * The driver packages for some Unix platforms are larger than
              expected, causing excessive space to be consumed when the driver is 
              installed.
   
            * On Windows, when you execute a SQL statement that contains a 
              Unix line feed character, the driver returns an error.

            Version 16.20.00.1028 Resolved Issues
            * JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication
            
              You can now authenticate your connection using a JSON web token. For more 
              information, see the ODBC Driver for Teradata User Guide.
              
            * Logging improvements
            
              When logging is enabled, the driver now logs calls from the TeraSSO
              and LCC dependencies in the connection logs instead of in the driver logs.
              
            * When you rename a DSN, the driver creates an additional DSN
              with the new name instead of just updating the name of the existing DSN.
              
            * When the Connection dialog box reopens after insufficient
              connection information has been provided, the dialog box does not contain
              all of the information that has already been specified through the DSN or 
              connection string.
   
              This issue has been resolved. The driver now consistently populates the 
              Connection dialog box with any information that has already been provided.
   
            * When establishing a connection based on a DSN-less connection
              string, the driver does not use the correct default session mode.

            Version 16.20.00.1024
            * SET TRANSFORM GROUP FOR TYPE statements supported
 
              You can now execute statements using the new SET TRANSFORM GROUP FOR TYPE
              syntax when connected to a Teradata Database instance that also supports
              this feature. These statements enable you to change the active transform 
              that the driver uses for complex data types that have multiple transforms 
              on the session level. For more information, see the Installation and 
              Configuration Guide.
          
            * Upgraded scalar function support
 
              You can now use the driver to call any scalar function that is supported by
              the Teradata Database instance that you are connected to.
          
            * SPNEGO (Simple and Protected GSSAP Negotiation) authentication
              is no longer supported.
   
              Support for SPNEGO authentication has been removed from the Teradata
              ODBC Driver, for consistency with the legacy Teradata ODBC Driver. SPNEGO
              authentication is deprecated in the legacy driver. 
            
            * When you use the driver with the DataDirect driver manager, the
              driver fails to convert ANSI ODBC function calls to Unicode ODBC function 
              calls.

            * In some cases, when SQLFreeHandle is called, the driver core
              dumps. 
   
            * When retrieving a Unicode character column with a column size
              that is less than 3, the driver returns an error.
   
            * The UPT Mode option does not work if you configure it using
              the ODBC Administrator on macOS.
 
            * Driver fails to convert CHAR data into TIMESTAMP data if the
              value contains leading spaces. 
   
            * When the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 
              dependency is missing, the driver returns the following error message: 
   
              [ODBC Teradata Driver] (45) Cannot find terasso library.
   
              This issue has been resolved. The driver now returns a more accurate error
              message when the Visual C++ Redistributable is misisng.
   
            * When you connect to Teradata Database version 16.00 or
              earlier and call the BIT_LENGTH function, the driver returns an error.
   
              This issue has been resolved. The problem occurred because BIT_LENGTH is
              not supported in Teradata Database 16.00 and earlier. The driver has been
              updated to use the OCTET_LENGTH instead of BIT_LENGTH when connected to
              Teradata Database 16.00 and earlier. 
   
            * When casting a decimal value to WCHAR data, the driver does
              not use the decimal symbol that is specified by your machine's regional 
              settings.
   
            * Driver cannot handle authentication parameter strings that
              are longer than 256 characters.
   
            * Setting the Database property in the connection string does
              not override the DefaultDatabase setting saved in the DSN.
 
              This issue has been resolved. You can now set the Database property in a
              connection string to override the DefaultDatabase setting saved in the DSN
              that you are using to connect to Teradata Database. This is the expected
              behavior, given that settings specified in connection strings should take
              precedence over settings saved in DSNs, and that the Database key is
              synonymous with the DefaultDatabase key.

            Version 16.20.00.1018 Resolved Issues
            * Support for TIME values in INTEGER and FLOAT formats

              You can now read and write TIME values given in INTEGER, FLOAT, and ANSI
              formats. Before, the driver supported TIME values in ANSI format only.

            * The OutConnectionString returned by the driver from a call to
              SQLDriverConnect no longer contains unnecessary key-value pairs. This scenario
              happened when the driver needed to collect additional information
              (DriverCompletion=SQL_DRIVER_PROMPT) from the user in order to make a
              connection to the data source (e.g. no password specified in the connection
              string or DSN). Because of a .NET limitation, .NET applications would fail if
              the length of OutConnectionString exceeds 1023 characters.
          
            * User credentials can be exposed in the driver's tracing log if they are passed
              in through a connection string. This issue has been resolved. Values such as 
              user name and password are no longer included in the tracing logs.
          
            * Batch insertion on a NUMBER column no longer reuses the first array element.
          
            * LIKE query with ESCAPE keyword no longer results in a database error.
          
            * The mechanism key value is no longer case sensitive.
              You can now use "ldap" instead of "LDAP".
                  
                  
            Version 16.20.00.1012 Resolved Issues

            * After a SQLExecute call with bound parameters returns an error, when you
              call SQLPrepare, the driver terminates unexpectedly.

            * Driver returns a "memory allocation error" when bound parameters are close 
              to the 1MB size limit, but do not actually exceed this limit.

              This error occurred because the driver adds packet overhead to the outgoing
              message, which can cause the message to exceed the 1MB limit.

              The driver now returns a more accurate error message when this scenario 
              occurs: "SQL request with parameters exceeds maximum allowed length of 
              1MB".

            * The REGIONALDECIMALSYMBOL key, which is the backup key name for the "Use 
              Regional Settings for Decimal Symbol" configuration option (the 
              UseRegionalSettings property), is misspelled as REGIONALDEICIMALSYMBOL 
              instead. 

            * The driver does not support SQL_ATTR_NOSCAN.

            * On Unix platforms, the driver does not support code-page-based conventions
              for the Teradata ASCII session character set.

            * Kerberos and Integrated Security settings not available in the macOS UI.

              On macOS, you can now configure the settings related to Kerberos and 
              Integrated Security using the driver dialog boxes, in addition to 
              configuring them through a connection string or the odbc.ini file.

            * In the macOS UI, the "UPT Mode" option is mislabelled with an incorrect 
              requirement.

              Before, in the Driver Options dialog box on macOS, the requirement "V2R16
              and above" is shown under the "UPT Mode" option. This requirement does not
              actually apply to the UPT Mode option, so that text has been removed from
              the dialog box. 

            * When connecting through a Teradata ASCII session, the driver fails to 
              retrieve non-ASCII characters from Teradata tables that contain LATIN 
              columns.

            * When converting a SQL_C_NUMERIC value to SQL_FLOAT or SQL_DOUBLE, if the
              source value contains more significant digits than the target type allows,
              the driver silently truncates excess digits and returns SQL_SUCCESS.

              The driver now returns an error with SQL state 22003 and does not truncate
              the value. 

            * On Windows, if the required Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio
              2012 Update 4 is not installed, the driver causes the operating system to
              open a dialog box containing an error message.

              The driver now prevents the operating system from opening a dialog box and
              instead returns the following error message:
              [Teradata][ODBC Teradata Driver] (45) Cannot find terasso library

           
            Version 16.20.00.0008 Resolved Issues
            * When you call SQLTables using a wildcard character for the schema name and 
              without specifying a table name, the driver returns a record for each table 
              in the database.
              
              This issue has been resolved. The driver now returns a record for each
              schema, as expected.
    
            * Driver does not close cursors and free server resources after SQLPrepare
              and SQLExecute calls.
              
            * In some cases, when attempting to retrieve metadata for a query that
              contains a wide-character field, the driver returns a value that can cause
              some applications to fail.
              
              This error occurs due to a known issue in 64-bit .NET applications, where
              the application cannot accept the metadata for wide-character data that 
              exceeds 2,147,483,647 bytes in size. 
              
              As a workaround, enable the new "Return Max CLOB/WCLOB Length as 32 bits" 
              option (the Use32bitMaxClobOctetSize property). For more information, see
              the Installation and Configuration Guide.

            Ubuntu 18.04 LTS            on EM64T

    3.1.1 Korn shell

System Requirements:
        When installing on a Linux system, use the Korn shell (pdksh) before running the
        installation procedure for Teradata Tools and Utilities. This ensures correct execution of the
        installation script.  Refer to the
            - Teradata Tools and Utilities for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide
            - Teradata Tools and Utilities for SUSE Linux Installation Guide


        Note: There has been instances where the Base O/S does not have the pdksh package installed.

    3.2 O/S Compatibility Packages

        Given that the ODBC Application, Driver Manager, and ODBC Driver may be compiled and linked using different
        versions of the compiler and linker, a compatibility package may need to be installed onto the target
        machine in order to satisfy a missing libstdc++ dependency.

        To check the libstdc++ version installed on the system:
            - on RedHat, SUSE, or Oracle the command "rpm -q libstdc++" can be executed
            - on Ubuntu, the command is "dpkg -l libstdc++* | grep ^ii" can be executed

                O/S                           libstdc++  included on O/S
                ===                           ===================
        SUSE Enterprise 11            libstdc++libc6.2-2.so.3
        SUSE Enterprise 15            libstdc++libc6.2-2.so.3
        Ubuntu 16.04 LTS              libstdc++.so.6.0.21
        Ubuntu 18.04 LTS              libstdc++.so.6.0.21

        3.2.1 SUSE Enterprise 11

              Executables and libraries that have been linked using earlier SUSE Linux versions, may
              require a compatibility package to be installed in order to satisfy a dependency on the
              libstdc++libc6.2-2.so.3 library for the 32-bit environment.

              The libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 library is contained in the compat-libstdc++-7.3-2.96.118.i386.rpm
              package which needs to be downloaded and installed onto the system.  An alternative is to
              download and install the compat-libstdc++-8-3.3.4.2.i386.rpm package which provides both the
              libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 and libstdc++.so.5 libraries

    3.3 Supported Teradata Database versions

            Teradata Database 15.10
            Teradata Database 16.10

    3.4 ODBC Dependencies

    3.5 ODBC Application development

        When developing an ODBC C++ application, the developer must use the
        recommended compiler
        1) Red Hat - GNU Project C and C++ Compiler Version 3.2.3
        2) SUSE    - GNU Project C and C++ Compiler Version 3.3.3

        Be sure to specify the correct compiler options when compiling your
        64-bit application with gcc/g++ C/C++ and use -DODBC64 to enable the
        64-bit definitions in the Driver Manager include files.


4.0 ODBC Software Installation/Uninstallation

    4.1 ODBC Dependencies

        Prior to installing the "ODBC Driver for Teradata", the dependency products that are listed
        in section 3.4 must be installed first and in the order listed below.

5.0 Configuration

    The support of both 32-bit and 64-bit ODBC Drivers on the same system will
    require the users to review their procedures in creating and maintaining
    their ini files.  It is important that separate ini files are maintained for
    the 32-bit and 64-bit ODBC Drivers.

    5.1 ODBC and ODBCINST INI Configuration

        A template odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini file are available in the 32-bit
        and 64-bit common ODBC directories.  It is strongly recommended that the ini
        files in the common directories be used as they are release independent of the
        TTU release directories.
        Common Directories:
            <InstallDir>/teradata/client/ODBC_32
            <InstallDir>/teradata/client/ODBC_64

        5.1.1 odbc.ini

        By default, the .odbc.ini  file is  expected to  be in  the  user's
        home directory but the ODBCINI environment variable  may be used
        to specify the pathname of the .odbc.ini file.  A sample of this file
        containing Teradata DSN entries can be copied from the recommended
        ODBC Directories
            <install dir>/teradata/client/ODBC_32/odbc.ini
            <install dir>/teradata/client/ODBC_64/odbc.ini
        These template files do not have the leading period, so when copying these
        files to a user's home directory a leading period must be added.

        5.1.2 odbcinst.ini

        The odbcinst.ini is read by the Driver Manager to determine which drivers
        are currently installed, and their ODBC SDK compliance.  There is just
        one odbcinst.ini file per the InstallDir value set in the odbc.ini file
        and resides in the InstallDir directory.

        Note:  A common error seen when running an ODBC application is the
               inability to load the ODBC driver.  The cause is usually that of
               the .ini file not defining the exact location of the driver.  So,
               it is *key* that these .ini files contains the exact location of
               the ODBC driver(s) to be used.  The odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini will
               be automatically edited to reflect the location of the Teradata
               ODBC driver upon package installation.

6.0 Sample ODBC Applications

    6.1 adhoc C/C++ program

        This is a sample program which demonstrates how to
            - Connect to a Data Source
            - Execute a SQL statement
            - Retrieve the result set created from the SQL statement

        This sample program is written in both C and C++ language and is
        located under the 32-bit and 64-bit TTU release directories
             <install dir>/teradata/client/<ttu release>/odbc_32/samples
             <install dir>/teradata/client/<ttu release>/odbc_64/samples


7.0 Restrictions

    When calling SQLBindParameter with a data type that contains fractional seconds, 
    you must set the DecimalDigit to 6 as that is what the driver will truncate to.  
    Previous to 16.20, this could be any number between 0-6 with the same result 
    as if you were to set it to 6, but this is incorrect and no longer supported.
    
    7.1 ODBC restrictions


    7.2 Binary Compatibilities


8.0 Limitations/Issues

    8.1 DR 151194 -- STVTEST: 3P - ODBC application core dumps if ODBCINI not set.

        This is a Driver Manager 6.1 problem where the ODBC Application will encounter a segmentation fault
        when the ODBCINI and ODBCINSTINI are not set.

        DataDirect's Defect ID is DD00059652 and the corresponding KnowledgeBase Article is
        8869 : Segmentation fault when ODBCINI and ODBCINST are missing using Connect for ODCB 6.1 and Connect64 for ODBC 6.1
               <http://cp-datadirect.kb.net/al/12/1/article.aspx?aid=8869&bt=4>

    8.2 DR 151192 -- STVTEST: 3P - Memory corruption seen in the driver manager 6.1

        This is a Driver Manager 6.1 problem where the ODBC Application will experience to types of failures

            1.     The Driver Manager trace logic overwrites memory when appending the log sequence number.


    8.3 DR 152281 -- Change ODBC 14.0 SQLGetInfo(SQL_KEYWORDS) to return the same keyword list as in 13.10

        SQLGetInfo(SQL_KEYWORDS) returns 13.10 keyword list on Linux/Unix
        =================================================================
        On Linux and Unix systems the SQLGetInfo call with InfoType SQL_KEYWORDS by default
        returns the keyword list corresponding to Teradata database 13.10 and not 14.0 even when
        working with a 14.0 database. This limitation is due to a restriction in the Linux/Unix
        Driver Manager.  If a future version of the Driver Manager without the restriction is used
        with the ODBC Driver for Teradata then the environment variable setting
        ENABLE_REL_14_SQL_KEYWORDS=Yes can be used to enable the return of the keyword list
        corresponding to Teradata database 14.0 by the ODBC Driver for Teradata.

Appendix A - ODBC Coexistence (32-bit and 64-bit)
             ====================================

    The coexistence of the 32-bit and 64-bit ODBC Driver on a single system introduces a
    new dimension to managing the ODBC Drivers.  The main item to remember is that these
    two ODBC Drivers are two separate sub-directories.  And the odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini
    can not be shared between them.  In viewing the tree structure in Appendix B, you will
    see an odbc_32 and odbc_64 directory for the 32-bit and 64-bit ODBC Driver.



Appendix B - ODBC Integrated Directories
             ===========================

    This Appendix categorizes the different sections of the ODBC Integrated
    directories and what their purposes are.

Appendix C - libstdc++ library dependency
             ========================

             An ODBC Application will fail to execute on a REDHAT AS 3.0 system if the libstdc++.so.6 library
             does not exist on the system.  Below is an example of what information is displayed.

             When building the 32-bit C++ sample ODBC application as a 32-bit executable on a 64-bit system it
             may be necessary to install libstdc++43-devel-32bit on SUSE 11 64Bit OS otherwise the application
             may complain about the following linking errors.

Appendix D - Client Usage Note on SLOB transfer from Server to Client
             ========================================================

                    --- Teradata ODBC Driver 16.10 and later ---

    Terminology:

        LOB:    Large OBject

        CLOB:   Character LOB (a data type)

        BLOB:   Binary LOB (a data type)

        SLOB:   Smart LOB (a transport mechanism)

        DLOB:   Deferred LOB (a transport mechanism)

        Response Message:
                A message containing multiple data items returned from the
                database to the driver.

        Maximum Response Message Bytes (MaxRespSize):
                The maximum size of a response message; configurable by
                the client, up to a maximum of 16 MB.

        Maximum Single LOB Bytes (MaxSingleLOBBytes):
                The maximum size of any one SLOB (CLOB, BLOB) item. Configurable
                by the client. Default is 0.

        Total LOB Bytes Per Row (MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow):
                The maximum size of all LOB bytes per row. Configurable by
                the client. Default is 0.

    In previous versions of Teradata ODBC Driver, non-LOB data are retrieved
    from the database to the driver in-line. Each LOB data item requires a
    round trip to the database for retrieval. This is not very efficient if
    the LOB data items are relatively small.

    Starting in TD ODBC Driver 16.10, LOB data can be retrieved from the
    database to the driver in-line, if certain size restrictions are met.

    This note describes how the client can configure the driver to return LOB
    data in-line.

    When the driver retrieves a LOB data item via an additional round trip,
    the mechanism is called deferred LOB (DLOB).

    When the database returns a LOB item in-line, the mechanism is called
    Smart LOB (SLOB).

    The client has no way of knowing the actual mechanism for any LOB item
    transfer. The client may experience better or worse performance.

    When either MaxSingleLOBBytes or MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow is 0, the database
    will not send any SLOBs; all LOBs are sent as DLOB.

    Currently, MaxSingleLOBBytes defaults to 4000 and MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow 
    defaults to 65536.

    Users can configure their preferred MaxSingleLOBBytes and
    MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow values using the following methods.

    1. In Windows,
        a. start up Microsoft ODBC Administrator,
        b. select the appropriate data source (in User DSN tab or System DSN tab),
        c. click [Configure…], click [Options>>], click [Advanced].
        d. Enter preferred values of MaxResponseBufferSize, MaxSingleLOBBytes
           and MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow in the appropriate text boxes.

    2.   In UNIX, edit the odbc.ini file. Add or change the following values.

                [my_test_dsn]
                MaxRespSize            = 10000000
                MaxSingleLOBBytes      =  1000000
                MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow = 10000000

    3.   Add to the connection string.

                MaxRespSize=10000000;MaxSingleLOBBytes=1000000;
                MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow=10000000

    When both MaxSingleLOBBytes and MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow are greater than 0,
    then the database will respond as follows:

       If ((the size of current LOB) < (MaxSingleLOBBytes)
            AND
           ((the current cumulative total size of SLOBs) < (MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow))
          )
       then the current LOB will be sent as SLOB,
       otherwise the current LOB will be sent as DLOB.

    To maximize data transfer efficiency (from database to driver to client),
    the following should be noted:

    SLOB items are returned in order of column numbers and may span several
    response messages. The driver only keeps a maximum of two response
    messages at any one time. For example, when the driver is processing
    messages 2 and 3, the SLOB data that was originally in message 1 is
    destroyed and is no longer available.

    It is advisable (for efficiency reasons) to access SLOB data items
    sequentially (using SQLBindCol(), or SQLGetData(col i) where i is
    increasing. For example,

        SQLGetData(col 2) (SLOB is in response message 1)
        SQLGetData(col 8) (SLOB is in response message 3)
        SQLGetData(col 9) (SLOB is in response message 3)

    When retrieving LOB data randomly, the data may not be copied from SLOB
    data, but through the less efficient deferred LOB (DLOB) method. For
    example:

        SQLGetData(col 8) (SLOB is in response message 3)
        SQLGetData(col 9) (SLOB is in response message 3)
        SQLGetData(col 2) (SLOB was in response message 1, already deleted)

    If SLOBs from columns 8 and 9 resides in the same response message, they
    will be copied from the SLOBs to the client. If SLOB from col2 resides in
    a previous response message, the message is probably destroyed after
    accessing columns 8 and 9; hence the LOB from col 2 is retrieved as
    deferred LOB (DLOB) (even though it was already retrieved once before as
    SLOB and discarded).

    Note that LOB data items are always retrievable in any sequence; they are
    either retrieved as SLOB or DLOB. SLOB retrieval through sequential
    access is more efficient than DLOB retrieval through random access.

    A client has the ability to decide (to some degree) which LOB columns are
    to be retrieved as SLOB while others are to be retrieved on-demand as
    DLOB. There is no mechanism to advise the database to send LOB data of
    specific columns as SLOBs. The client configurable parameter
    MaxSingleLOBBytes is a surrogate method to achieve this. For example, if
    a database contains two columns: photo thumbnails of no more than 1 MB
    each, and high definition photos that are much greater 1 MB each. Let us
    say a (contrived) client application will only process the high definition
    photos if the thumbnail contains blue sky. The client should configure
    MaxSingleLOBBytes as 1 MB. So thumbnails are always retrieved as SLOB and
    high definition photos are retrieved as DLOB, and only if needed.

    Another example. If we know ahead of time that columns 1 to 3 are always
    1 MB or less and we want to send these as SLOB always; and columns 4 to 10
    are 10 MB each and we never want to send these as SLOB. Then we can
    configure the following:

        MaxRespSize            =  3100000
        MaxSingleLOBBytes      =  1000000  // each SLOB
        MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow =  3000000  // sum of all SLOBs

    The MaxRespSize should be big enough to contain all SLOB data plus all
    non-LOB data (such as integer, varchar, deferred LOB locator information)
    of the row.

    The value of MaxRespSize can be tuned to meet application data processing
    efficiency. If the data columns are independent of each other and
    parallel processing is possible, then MaxRespSize can be set to be less
    than the sum of the sizes of all SLOB columns (so that SLOBs are sent back
    in several response messages). If all the data from all the columns are
    needed by the application before processing can begin, then we want all
    SLOBs to be sent in one response message; in this case we want to set
    MaxRespSize to be (at least) the sum of the sizes of all SLOB columns (up
    to 16 MB).

    If MaxTotalLOBBytesPerRow is less than or equal to the MaxRespSize, then
    the driver will always cache all SLOB columns and non-LOB columns; thus an
    application can randomly access the data even though the recommendation is
    to retrieve the data in sequential access mode.
