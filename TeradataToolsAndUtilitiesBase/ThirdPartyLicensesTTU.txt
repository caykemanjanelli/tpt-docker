#    originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT

#    Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.

#    

#    Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

#    original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED

#    that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear

#    on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially

#    in the same form as set out herein and that such intended

#    distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise

#    contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having

#    jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.

#    

#    NO WARRANTY

#    

#    The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

#    research and development conducted during the project and is provided

#    to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the

#    program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,

#    implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein

#    includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,

#    performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of

#    the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of

#    any right of any third party.

#    

#    Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to

#    have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for

#    the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or

#    otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

#    

#    Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other

#    organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the

#    development of the program and their respective officials, directors,

#    officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all

#    damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental

#    and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection

#    with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material

#    or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,

#    regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had

#    knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the

#    project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the

#    foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term

#    "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,

#    modification, copying and distribution of the program and the

#    production of secondary products from the program.

#    

#    In the case where the program, whether in its original form or

#    modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from

#    any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or

#    grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in

#    writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted

#    from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted

#    above as far as the program is concerned.

4. Time Zone Database



ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.





7.  Database Ownership



  The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF

  document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work

  that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public

  domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply

  to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.

  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,

  the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in

  this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,

  currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court

  orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust

  on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the

  database or code waives all rights to future claims in that

  contribution or in the TZ Database.

OSAT 11219 for SQLite 3.30.1 for Teradata Wallet

SQLite Is Public Domain

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.
The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.
All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

Open-Source, not Open-Contribution

SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation. But SQLite is not open-contribution. In order to keep SQLite in the public domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from unknown persons.
All of the code in SQLite is original, having been written specifically for use by SQLite. No code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet.

Warranty of Title

SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license. Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use SQLite. Circumstances where this occurs include the following:
* Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement.
* You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the public domain.
* You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
* You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite.
* Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a license.
If any of the above circumstances apply to you, Hwaci, the company that employs all the developers of SQLite, will sell you a Warranty of Title for SQLite. A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed authors of SQLite are the true authors, and that the authors have the legal right to dedicate the SQLite to the public domain, and that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims. All proceeds from the sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund continuing improvement and support of SQLite.

Contributed Code

In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the project does not accept patches. If you would like to make a suggested change, and include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would be great. However please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch from scratch.

OSAT 2281 for zlib 1.2.4 for DUL

Version 2, June 1991 



Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. 



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 



We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. 



Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 



Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 



TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". 



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 



1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 



2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 



a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 



Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. 



In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 



3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 



a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 



If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 



4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 



5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 



6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 



7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 



8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 



9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 



10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 



NO WARRANTY



11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 



12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 



one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.

Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author



This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2

of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

GNU General Public License for more details.



You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: 



Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details

type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome

to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 

for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: 



Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright

interest in the program `Gnomovision'

(which makes passes at compilers) written 

by James Hacker.



signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License

This document details the licensing terms of the iODBC project. It is currently maintained by iodbc@openlinksw.com; please feel free to send comments and questions to this address.



Dual-LicensingThe iODBC driver manager is provided dual-licensed under the terms of both the Library GNU Public License Version 2, dated June 1991, or the New BSD license, at your choice.



Key points of both licensesThe LGPL is a complex document, but it gives you the rights to take the software, to use it yourself, and to link commercial software against it without having to make the source to your whole application available.



The BSD License is more simple; use, modification and redistribution are permitted as long as the copyright and disclaimer notices are retained, and no attempt to use the authors to endorse advertising is made. This includes the ability to take the iODBC driver manager sources, build them and ship with your application, without having to adjust the terms of your application's license.

LGPL                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

                      Version 2, June 1991



Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

                   51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is

numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]



                           Preamble



 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your

freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public

Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change

free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.



 This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some

specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any

other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for

your libraries, too.



 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you

have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for

this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it

if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it

in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.



 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid

anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if

you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.



 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis

or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave

you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source

code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide

complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them

with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling

it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.



 Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright

the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal

permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.



 Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain

that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free

library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we

want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original

version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on

the original authors' reputations.



 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software

patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free

software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect

transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,

we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's

free use or not licensed at all.



 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary

GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This

license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain

designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary

one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is

the same as in the ordinary license.



 The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that

they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a

program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without

changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is

analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in

a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a

derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License

treats it as such.



 Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General

Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software

sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We

concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.



 However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the

users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the

libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to

permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while

preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free

libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve

this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards

changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this

will lead to faster development of free libraries.



 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a

"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The

former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only

works together with the library.



 Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary

General Public License rather than by this special one.



                 GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which

contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized

party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library

General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is

addressed as "you".



 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data

prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs

(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.



 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work

which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the

Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under

copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a

portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated

straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is

included without limitation in the term "modification".)



 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means

all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated

interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation

and installation of the library.



 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not

covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of

running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from

such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based

on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for

writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does

and what the program that uses the Library does.

 

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's

complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that

you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an

appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact

all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any

warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the

Library.



 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,

and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a

fee.



 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion

of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and

distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1

above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.



   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices

   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.



   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no

   charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.



   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a

   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses

   the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility

   is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,

   in the event an application does not supply such function or

   table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of

   its purpose remains meaningful.



   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has

   a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the

   application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any

   application-supplied function or table used by this function must

   be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square

   root function must still compute square roots.)



These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If

identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,

and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in

themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those

sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you

distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based

on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the

entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote

it.



Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest

your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to

exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or

collective works based on the Library.



In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library

with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of

a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under

the scope of this License.



 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public

License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do

this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so

that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,

instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the

ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify

that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in

these notices.



 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for

that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all

subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.



 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of

the Library into a program that is not a library.



 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or

derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form

under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany

it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which

must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a

medium customarily used for software interchange.



 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy

from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the

source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to

distribute the source code, even though third parties are not

compelled to copy the source along with the object code.



 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the

Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or

linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a

work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and

therefore falls outside the scope of this License.



 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library

creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it

contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the

library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.



 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file

that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a

derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be

linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The

threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.



 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data

structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline

functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object

file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative

work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the

Library will still fall under Section 6.)



 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may

distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.

Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,

whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.



 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or

link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a

work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work

under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit

modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse

engineering for debugging such modifications.



 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the

Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by

this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work

during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the

copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference

directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one

of these things:



   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding

   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever

   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under

   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked

   with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that

   uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the

   user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified

   executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood

   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the

   Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application

   to use the modified definitions.)



   b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at

   least three years, to give the same user the materials

   specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more

   than the cost of performing this distribution.



   c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy

   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above

   specified materials from the same place.



   d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these

   materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.



 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the

Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for

reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,

the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally

distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major

components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on

which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies

the executable.



 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license

restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally

accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot

use both them and the Library together in an executable that you

distribute.



 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the

Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library

facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined

library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on

the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise

permitted, and provided that you do these two things:



   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work

   based on the Library, uncombined with any other library

   facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the

   Sections above.



   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact

   that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining

   where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.



 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute

the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any

attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or

distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your

rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,

or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not

signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or

distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are

prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by

modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the

Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying

the Library or works based on it.



 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the

Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the

original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library

subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further

restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to

this License.



 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not

excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot

distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this

License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you

may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by

all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then

the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to

refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,

and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any

patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any

such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the

integrity of the free software distribution system which is

implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made

generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that

system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing

to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot

impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to

be a consequence of the rest of this License.



 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in

certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the

original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add

an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,

so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus

excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if

written in the body of this License.



 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new

versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.

Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,

but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library

specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and

"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and

conditions either of that version or of any later version published by

the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a

license version number, you may choose any version ever published by

the Free Software Foundation.



 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free

programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,

write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is

copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free

Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our

decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status

of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing

and reuse of software generally.



                           NO WARRANTY



 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO

WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR

OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY

KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME

THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN

WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY

AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU

FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE

LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A

FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

DAMAGES.



                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries



 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest

possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that

everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting

redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the

ordinary General Public License).



 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is

safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively

convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the

"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



   <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



   This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

   modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public

   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

   version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



   This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU

   Library General Public License for more details.



   You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public

   License along with this library; if not, write to the Free

   Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your

school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if

necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:



 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

 library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

 Perl5 is Copyright (C) 1993-2005, by Larry Wall and others.
It is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of either:
a) the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version, or
b) the "Artistic License".


Teradata chooses to release this software under the Artistic License, the text of which follows:

           The "Artistic License"



               Preamble



The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a

Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some

semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,

while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute

the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make

reasonable modifications.



Definitions:



   "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the

   Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files

   created through textual modification.



   "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been

   modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes

   of the Copyright Holder as specified below.



   "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or

   copyrights for the package.



   "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing

   this Package.



   "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the

   basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,

   and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the

   Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large

   as a market that must bear the fee.)



   "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item

   itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.

   It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it

   under the same conditions they received it.



1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the

Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you

duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.



2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications

derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package

modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.



3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided

that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and

when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the

following:



   a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them

   Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or

   an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive

   site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include

   your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.



   b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.



   c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict

   with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide

   a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly

   documents how it differs from the Standard Version.



   d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.



4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or

executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:



   a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,

   together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where

   to get the Standard Version.



   b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of

   the Package with your modifications.



   c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly

   document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together

   with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.



   d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.



5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this

Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this

Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,

you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly

commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software

distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a

product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within

an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere

form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the

interpreter is so embedded.



6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as

output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall

under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated

them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this

Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this

Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a

binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall

neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it

fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do

not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this

Package.



7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other

languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to

emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this

Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the

equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do

not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the

regression tests for the language.



8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always

permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,

when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible

to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be

construed as a distribution of this Package.



9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote

products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.



10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR

IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.



               The End

=====================

The full text of the GPL 1.0 is below:

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                     Version 1, February 1989

 Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.
